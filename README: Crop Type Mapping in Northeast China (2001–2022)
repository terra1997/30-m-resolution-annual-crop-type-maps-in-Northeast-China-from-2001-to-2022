1. Overview

This repository contains Google Earth Engine (GEE) scripts for mapping multi-crop types using gap-filled Landsat data in Northeast China. The workflow integrates multi-source satellite imagery and slected features to produce annual crop maps at 30-m resolution. The script is designed to be adaptable to different years, regions, and agro-climatic zones.

2. Dependencies
Google Earth Engine account
Access to the following GEE assets (all provided with proper permissions):
  AOI: A small region is used for an example
  Gap-filled Landsat image collections
  Ground truth training samples
  Cropland mask (Potapov et al., Nat Food 2021)
  Meteorological data: temperature, precipitation, soil moisture

3. Installation
Clone or copy the GEE script to your GEE Code Editor workspace.
Ensure you have read/write access to the specified asset paths or update paths to your own assets.
Optional: adjust configuration parameters to your study year and region.

4. Workflow

Data Preparation
   Load boundary vectors, training samples, gap-filled Landsat images, cropland mask, and meteorological data.
Monthly Image Processing
  Compute median composites for each month (Aprilâ€“October).
   Compute vegetation indices and GWCCI band.
Feature Preparation
   Stack all indices, GWCCI, and meteorological variables into a final image for classification.
Model Training & Classification
   Train Random Forest classifier using training samples.
Classify and mask with cropland.
Export classified crop maps to GEE assets.

5. Notes / Adaptation Guidelines

To adapt for other regions, replace the zone variable with training samples for your study area.
To use different years, update year and ensure gap-filled Landsat and meteorological data exist for the year.
Make sure all asset paths are accessible to your GEE account or modify paths to your own assets.
Consider using a smaller fishnet grid for very large areas to reduce processing time.
